# Style_20 - Constructivist
Description from [Exercises in Programming Style](http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371/)
* Every single function checks the sanity of its arguments and either returns something sensible when the arguments are unreasonable or assigns them reasonable values.
* All code blocks check for possible errors and escape the block when things go wrong, setting the state to something reasonable, and continuing to execute the rest of the function.
