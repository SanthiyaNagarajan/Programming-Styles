# Style_Arrays - Arrays
Description from [Exercises in Programming Style](http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371/)

* Main data type: array - a fixed-size collection of elements.
* No explicit iteration; instead, an array is accessed by high-level, declarative operations.
* Computation unfolds as search, selection, and transformation of fixed-size data.
