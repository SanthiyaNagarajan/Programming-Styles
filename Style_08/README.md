Description from [Exercises in Programming Style](http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371/)
* Each function takes an additional parameter, usually the last, which is another function.
* That function parameter is applied at the end of the current function.
* That function parameter is given, as input, what would be the output
of the current function.
* The larger problem is solved as a pipeline of functions, but where the next function to be applied is given as parameter to the current function.
