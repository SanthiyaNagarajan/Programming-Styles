# Style_21 - Tantrum
Description from [Exercises in Programming Style](http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371/)
* Every single procedure and function checks the sanity of its arguments and refuses to continue when the arguments are unreasonable.
* All code blocks check for all possible errors, possibly log context-specific messages when errors occur, and pass the errors up the function call chain.
